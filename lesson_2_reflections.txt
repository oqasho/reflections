What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repositiry, git greates a .git file which will start to track everything as per what I do with it next.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

working directory has files of all kids in it, yet the staging area has the files that we need to track and commit at once.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By checking out the diff with the staging area and the last commit and making sure that it contains the logical changes that you need. Also, by making sure to add the files to the staging area so that when they are commited, it following a perfectly logical point to commit.
