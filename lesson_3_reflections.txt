When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your work with other people and when you want to collaborate with other people remotely.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you don't know if you always want up pull everything that gets updated on GitHub as someone else might be working on the same project and you might even end up loading a file onto your local repository (a file created by you or anyone else) that you deleted from GitHub and you didn't realize that you have it in your local repository now.



What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It will allow us to be able to track our work and what we stored online or didn't yet. It also will help regulate the branches when we push or pull and there are changed already.



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would do so by sharing documents and talking to my collaborators and doing things manually. It's definately much harder to do that rather than using Git and GitHub.
